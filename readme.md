Welcome to my little digital world 🌙

This portfolio site is my creative retreat developed as part of the Web Engineering (EWEB FS25) module at the Bern University of Applied Sciences.
It brings together technology and aesthetics, clarity and lightness. While browsing through the site, you might sense my love for minimalist design – reduced, yet refined with carefully placed accents, inspired by the Japanese design philosophy 「引き算の美学」(Hikizan no Bigaku): the aesthetics of subtraction.
A digital balance between function and form, between intentional emptiness and purposeful detail.

The site is fully responsive, adapts to any screen size, and offers both dark and light modes for changing moods.
Animated text smoothly transitions between my professional roles, accompanied by a calming and dreamy Japanese melody played in the background – manually and mindfully initiated.

A single or double click on the music icon opens a small Spotify window. A further click on the round symbol on the far right of the player starts the music. The song continues to play until the end – even if you navigate to another page like the About section.

The contact form is implemented as a modal window – subtle, yet with personality. Thanks to Formspree, messages can be submitted directly without any server magic in the background. After sending a message, visitors are gently redirected back to the homepage – without breaking the flow.

I focused on thoughtful design, calming colors, and small visual details – all with the goal of creating a harmonious user experience.

Thank you for visiting 🌸
