            Hi, I'm Tamara Stefania, an Information Systems student specializing in Software Architecture, currently in my final year at the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH). 
            My journey into the world of technology didn't start with a traditional IT background but with a deep fascination for programming—a passion that was sparked early on thanks 
            to my brother, who began an apprenticeship in IT. I often got to watch him work and that gave me my first insights into the tech world. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Business Analyst with several years of experience in process development, project management, and as a Scrum Master, I'm used to understanding complex requirements and
            developing structured solutions. In the previous semester, I laid the foundation for my bachelor's thesis with a web scraping concept. This coming semester, I'll continue to
            build on it, integrating UX/UI aspects—a passion project that combines technical expertise and creativity. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I especially enjoy designing and developing modern websites. This interest has grown through various study modules. Although I don't have a classic developer background, I 
            hope to increasingly focus on web design and frontend development in my future career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I'm a mom to a young boy. Balancing family, studies, and work is definitely a challenge but also incredibly fulfilling. It teaches me every day to set 
            priorities and pursue my goals with passion and focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love connecting with people—whether in German, French, Spanish, English, Italian, Portuguese, or Swiss German. Empathy, authenticity, respect, and sustainability are 
            values that guide my thinking and actions. I'm especially passionate about using technology meaningfully—always with people at the center.

            I would describe myself as a cheerful and open-minded person—a smile is almost always on my face. I truly believe that every challenge holds the potential to grow, and that a 
            positive attitude can take you far.
          </p>
